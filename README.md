# Survival-Analysis
Project done on survival analysis with cancer patients data set using m-state package of R in Master's 
The plots are generated using Python/ R. The dataset was used from European Bone Marrow Transformation (EBMT).
There is a project report here which contains descriptions of the works performed. There are 2 parts in this project where in the 1st part, I performed KM estimation on a dataset and effects of different single variables on survival of patients were analyzed such as gender, age etc. 
In the 2nd part we moved on to multi-state models. This time we analyzed survival of patients on dataset that contains multiple events and we produced transition probability matrix for each patient and was able to draw some insights regarding their survival.
